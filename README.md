# MemoryGame

Springboard Memory Game Project

Here is my Springboard Software Engineering Career Track course Section 4 Challenge to create a Memory Game using html, css and Javascript. 

The task for this project was to build a memory game that shows a collection of cards, face down, that can be clicked to reveal whats underneath. If the cards match, they remain facing up, and if they do not match then they flip back down. 

Requirements were to make sure that it worked only if you click two different cards, and to make sure the cards cannot be clicked too quickly to guess more than two cards at a time. 

I found this project very interesting as it was one of the first times we joined html, css and javascript during this course. I found this project pretty straight forward and am looking forward to coming back to it to make some changes like adding start and restart buttons, adding a score variable, storing a lowest score variable, allowing for a selected number of cards to be played, and changing the colors to images or gifs.
